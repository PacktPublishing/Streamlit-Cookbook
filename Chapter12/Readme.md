## Chapter 12 - Improving Streamlit Application Performance

In this chapter, we will explore several key themes that will help improve the performance capabilities of your Streamlit applications. These themes include:

- Caching: We will delve into the effective implementation of caching in Streamlit applications, particularly in scenarios involving expensive data fetching operations, computationally intensive tasks, and model predictions.
- Performance Profiling: Learn how to identify and optimize the most time-consuming parts of your applications using profiling data.
- Asynchronous Programming: Discover how to utilize asynchronous programming techniques to handle IO-bound tasks efficiently.
- Parallel Processing: Leverage parallel processing techniques to distribute computation across multiple cores or machines.
- Git LFS Integration: Explore the integration of Git LFS for handling large files effectively.
- Unused Data Removal: Learn strategies to remove unused data and enhance the overall performance of your applications.
