## Welcome to Chapter 3: Using Output Widgets

This folder contains **code snippets** that help to enhance your Streamlit web apps using widgets such as text formatting, displaying tabular data through
`st.table` and `st.dataframe`, presenting media content with `st.image`, `st.audio`, and `st.video`, showcasing task progress using the `st.progress`,
default graphing options like `st.line_chart()`, and much more.

**ðŸ“ŒNote:** *Follow the "commented code" (contains the subtopic name & code explanation) mentioned in every `.py` file for better flow!*
