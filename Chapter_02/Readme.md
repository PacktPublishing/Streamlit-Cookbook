## Welcome to Chapter 2: Using Input Widgets

This folder contains **code snippets** to make your Streamlit apps more aesthetically pleasing using widgets ranging from text/number input to `st.checkbox`, `st.selectbox` and `st.multiselect`, `st.slider`, `st.button` that allows users to download files, uploading files using `st.file_uploader` widget, and edit data in an editable dataframe using `st.data_editor`.


#### ðŸ“ŒNote: Content breakdown
- `user_responses.py` -- One file that stores all the code from sub-sections **1 to 5**
- **Buttons**, **Files upload**, and **Dataframes** folders, store the main `.py` files along with some media like images, and CSV files, which represents
    the code from sub-sections **6 to 8**

*Make sure to follow the "commented code" (contains the subtopic name & code explanation) mentioned in every `.py` file for better flow!*
